## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Responsive Design
- CSS Animation (Hover Effects & Transitions)


### What I learned

I found out about the :root in CSS is the same as making var varName = value in JavaScript

```css
:root {
    --main-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --font-size: 16px;
}

body {
    color: var(--main-color);
    font-size: var(--font-size);
}
```

In JavaScipt
```js
const mainColor = "hsl(75, 94%, 57%)";
const fontSize = "16px";

document.body.style.color = mainColor;
document.body.style.fontSize = fontSize;
```


### Continued development

I had fun doing this, I challenged myself to explore more options on how to make the code simpler while keeping the complexity of outcome.
